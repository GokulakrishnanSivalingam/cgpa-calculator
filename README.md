## üìã How CGPA is Calculated

The CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) is calculated based on the grades you achieve in each subject and their corresponding credits. Here‚Äôs how it works:

### Formula:
- **CGPA** = (Total Grade Points in all Semesters) / (Total Credits in all Semesters)

- **GPA** for each semester is calculated using:
  - GPA = (Sum of [Grade Points √ó Credits]) / (Sum of Credits)

### Grade Points Table

| Grade | Grade Points | Credits                                         |
|-------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| O     | 10           | Depends on the subject (typically 3 or 4 credits) |
| A+    | 9            | Depends on the subject                          |
| A     | 8            | Depends on the subject                          |
| B+    | 7            | Depends on the subject                          |
| B     | 6            | Depends on the subject                          |
| RA    | 0            | -                                               |

- The grades are assigned based on the marks obtained in each subject.
- Multiply the grade point by the corresponding credit hours to get the grade point for each subject.
- Sum the grade points for all subjects and divide by the total credits to get the GPA for the semester.
- The **CGPA** is the average of all semester GPAs, weighted by credits.
